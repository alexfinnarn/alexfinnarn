summary: In this post, I will set up a Symfony 5 website + Tailwind CSS on Heroku and go over some potential pain points in the process. Previously, I was setting up my website using Hugo as an attempt to learn Go, but I never really got around to writing any Go code to further my understanding. Now that I'm interested in continuing my PHP development journey, I can't think of a better framework to use than Symfony for many reasons that I will detail in future posts.

A post about creating a controller to read markdown and render in a Twig template.

Note:
- How to read contents of a file in PHP
- How to read files in a directory
- Started with services in the controller and then refactored to a FilesService object
- Started with knplabs markdown but switched to the League...for some reason
